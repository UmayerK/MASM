    ; Carry Flag = 0
    ; Overflow Flag = 1 Generated as adding the numbers 2 and 7FFF causes overflow as its 16 digits  and exceeds 32 thousand and ax is 64 thousand as its already full(after subtracting 1 ax register)
    ; Sign Flag = 1  Generated because the number  0 -1 is negative in cx register
    ; Zero Flag = 0

    ; Carry Flag = 0
    ; Overflow Flag = 1 Generated as adding the numbers  7FFEh + 22h to an already overflown number causes overflow as al is 8 bits and the FFFF plus anything is greater than what 8 bits can handle
    ; Sign Flag = 1 sf stays on as the most significant digit is 1

    ; Carry Flag = 1 this occurs as there is a carry done when adding 72h and 32h This is as subtracting 128 and 1 does not make it so the number is small enough to overflow 
    ; Overflow Flag = 0
    ; Sign Flag = 1 Generated because the number is negative -127 (bl register)
    ; Zero Flag = 0
    ; CX = 0000
